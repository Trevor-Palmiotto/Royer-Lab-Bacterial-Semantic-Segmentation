# Royer-Lab-Bacterial-Semantic-Segmentation
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) for data preprocessing, model pretraining, and fine-tuning, specifically for bacterial semantic segmentation of fluorescence microscopy data. The notebooks cover data cleaning, feature engineering, training initial models, and adapting pretrained models for segmentation tasks.
